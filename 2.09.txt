## Proof 1

the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function
only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted).

x: (xl, xu)
y: (yl, yu)

width(x) = (xu-xl)/2
width(y) = (yu-yl)/2

x+y: (xl+yl, xu+yu)

width(x+y) = ((xu+yu)-(xl+yl))/2
           = (xu-xl)/2+(yu-yl)/2
           = width(x) + width(y)

x-y: (xl-yu, xu-yl)
width(x-y) = ((xu-yl)-(xl-yu))/2
           = (xu-xl)/2+(yu-yl)/2
           = width(x) + width(y)
